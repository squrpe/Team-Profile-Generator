Unit testing was used to create the minimum requirements this application needed to fulfill. Each testing suite goes through each class function and tests their specific methods.

To test the application, make sure you've previously ran the command:

    npm i
    

This is to install the necessary packages needed for the project. Then type and run the follow command:

    npm test
    
  
For the tests to be correctly working, the output should state that 4 test suites passed, pictured below:
